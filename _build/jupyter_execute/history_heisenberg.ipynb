    "## A Historic View on the Heisenberg Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "When we teach quantum mechanics today, we usually begin with Schrödinger’s formulation, which is built on the wavefunction and the corresponding “wave equation.” Because we are intuitively familiar with the concept of waves, we tend to accept Schrödinger’s *wave mechanics* as a natural starting point. This is one reason why physicists and chemists quickly embraced Schrödinger’s approach to quantum theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often overlooked, however, that the **first** formulation of quantum mechanics was not Schrödinger’s but rather **Heisenberg’s**, and it emerged from a very different—and from today’s point of view, much more abstract—starting point.\n",
    "Now, since in the year 2025 quantum mechanics celebrates its **100th** anniversary, I find it appropriate to revisit the ideas and chain of thought that led Heisenberg to the formulation of his matrix mechanics in the epoch breaking paper entitled \"Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen\" that was submitted for publication in the *\"Zeitschrift für Physik\"* am 29.07.2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Heisenberg’s approach was the culmination of efforts by many, principally led by Niels Bohr and his school, to explain atomic phenomena, particularly atomic spectra. Heisenberg’s own account of the development of quantum mechanics is given in his beautiful book *Das Teil und das Ganze*. Apparently, he had a key idea during a vacation on Helgoland Island in **June 1925**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heisenberg followed a path initiated by Niels Bohr and his academic adviser Arnold Sommerfeld that led to the formulation of what is nowadays called the **old quantum theory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bohr introduced the concept of **stationary states** and postulated—without a proper physical reason—that systems in such states do not radiate light (as they should according to Maxwell’s electrodynamics). He postulated that radiation occurs only during **transitions** between these states, labeled by **two** quantum numbers, $m$ and $n$, and that the frequency of the emitted or absorbed radiation is given by the **Bohr frequency condition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega_{mn} \\;=\\; \\frac{E_m - E_n}{\\hbar}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas were introduced in Bohr’s landmark paper *“On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules,”* published in *Phil. Mag.* Ser. 6, Vol. 26, No. 151 (July 1913), and are now considered to be one of the cornerstones in the development of quantum physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Bohr’s proposal, experimentalists around the world began to study atomic spectra in great detail. The results of these efforts were essentially tables of transition frequencies $\\omega_{mn}$ and corresponding intensities, which we can denote by $P_{mn}$. Heisenberg’s academic teacher Arnold Sommerfeld published his monumental book *Atombau und Spektrallinien* around 1919; it became a bible of modern physics, popularizing new ideas and theories, and the young Heisenberg—one of its proofreaders—was surely influenced by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by Bohr’s work, theoreticians attempted to explain these findings by combining classical mechanics with quantization rules (such as the Sommerfeld–Wilson conditions), which selected certain classical orbits as “allowed.”\n",
    "These quantization rules chose a countable (discrete) set of classical orbits from the continuum of uncountably many possible ones. Thus, in such a theory the system is represented by a set $\\{x_n \\mid n = 0,1,2,\\dots\\}$ of stationary orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach successfully reproduced energy levels of some simple systems, it ultimately failed to fully explain the **structure** of atomic spectra and, in particular, could not account for the intensities of the various spectral lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where young Werner Heisenberg comes into play. Heisenberg, a deep thinker with a philosophical inclination, arrived at a radical conclusion by considering various *Gedanken* experiments devised to measure the stationary orbits. He concluded that on the atomic scale a classical trajectory (for example, of an electron in a hydrogen atom) is fundamentally **not observable**, since any attempt to measure it would disturb the system so much that no continuous trajectory could be reconstructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led him to the philosophically radical move of abandoning the concept of stationary orbits and postulating that a theory of atomic phenomena should be built **only on observable quantities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what were the observables at that time? By the 1920s, the scientific community was already immersed in vast tables of transition frequencies $\\omega_{mn}$ and their intensities $P_{mn}$. All these quantities were labeled by **two** numbers representing an initial and final state. Inspired by this, Heisenberg proposed to **replace the set of discrete classical orbits** $x_n(t)$ (labeled by a single index) with functions that depend on time and are labeled by **two** indices associated with a pair of Bohr stationary states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_n(t) \\;\\longrightarrow\\; x_{mn}(t) \\;=\\; x_{mn}\\, e^{-i\\omega_{mn} t}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, he proposes to replace discrete orbits by tables of numbers which we now of course all know as matrices !\n",
    "Each entry $x_{mn}$ was assumed to oscillate with the frequency of the corresponding observable transition $\\omega_{mn}$. Heisenberg further postulated that the tables should have a specific symmetry that we nowadays recognize as hermiticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{nm} \\;=\\; x_{mn}^{*}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original paper there is no explicit motivation given for this assumption. It was probably inspired by the reality of the Fourier coefficients in the expansion of a classical orbit and by the empirical fact—known from Einstein’s work on the $A$ and $B$ coefficients—that the rates of light absorption and stimulated emission are identical. Since the rates (intensities) are related to $|x_{mn}|^{2}$, hermiticity is natural. He further reasoned that the same type of assignment of a two-index set of quantities should hold for the momentum or any other physical quantity. A further key assumption was that **all** matrix elements should oscillate with precisely the **same** set of observable frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{mn}(t) \\;\\longrightarrow\\; p_{mn}\\, e^{-i\\omega_{mn} t}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, Heisenberg asked another fundamental question related to how one should calculate derived quantities like $x^{2}$ or $p^{2}$, needed to construct the energy (the Hamiltonian) of the system. A naïve element-wise squaring, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(x^{2})_{mn} \\;=\\; x_{mn}^{2}\\, e^{-2i\\omega_{mn} t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "would generate new frequencies not present in the observed spectra. To fix this, Heisenberg relied on the **Ritz combination principle**,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\omega_{mn} \\;=\\; \\omega_{ml} + \\omega_{ln},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and proposed the following rule, which automatically preserves a single set of transition frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(x^{2})_{mn}\\, e^{-i\\omega_{mn} t} \\;=\\; \\sum_{l} x_{ml}\\, e^{-i\\omega_{ml} t}\\; x_{ln}\\, e^{-i\\omega_{ln} t},\n",

    "$$\n",
    "(x^{2})_{mn} \\;=\\; \\sum_{l} x_{ml}\\, x_{ln}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, at the time he was developing quantum mechanics, Heisenberg did not know about matrices and matrix algebra—he discovered all of it by himself because the physics naturally led him to matrix rules!\n",
    "\n",
    "The same structure holds for momentum, with\n",

    "p = m\\dot{x}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad p_{mn} = -i m \\omega_{mn}\\, x_{mn}.\n",

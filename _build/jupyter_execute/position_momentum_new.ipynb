    "## Construction of Position and Momentum Observables via Translation Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce the observables corresponding to position and momentum in a semi-rigorous manner, using physical assumptions and basic operator theory. We avoid referring to \"position eigenstates,\" which do not exist in the Hilbert space of normalisable wavefunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Postulating the Position Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that there exists a self-adjoint operator $\\hat{x}$, called the **position operator**, with continuous spectrum, defined on a dense domain in the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} = L^2(\\mathbb{R})$. We consider a normalisable state $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle \\psi | \\hat{x} | \\psi \\rangle = x_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expectation value corresponds to the mean position of a particle in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Defining the Translation Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "We now postulate the existence of a **unitary translation operator** $T(a)$ which translates the expectation value of position by a real displacement $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle \\psi | T(a)^\\dagger \\hat{x} T(a) | \\psi \\rangle = x_0 + a\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that $T(a)$ implements a spatial shift. The action of $T(a)$ on the position operator satisfies the operator identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(a)^\\dagger \\hat{x} T(a) = \\hat{x} + a I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This identity can be verified for all states in a dense subset of the Hilbert space and is consistent with translation symmetry in quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Momentum as the Generator of Translations\n",
    "\n",
    "By **Stone's theorem**, a strongly continuous one-parameter group of unitary operators $T(a)$ must be generated by a self-adjoint operator. Therefore, there exists a self-adjoint operator $\\hat{p}$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(a) = e^{-i a \\hat{p} / \\hbar}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines the **momentum operator** $\\hat{p}$ as the generator of translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Deriving the Canonical Commutation Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "We now derive the fundamental commutation relation between position and momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiate the identity\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(a)^\\dagger \\hat{x} T(a) = \\hat{x} + a I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with respect to $a$ and evaluate at $a = 0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{da} \\left( e^{i a \\hat{p}/\\hbar} \\hat{x} e^{-i a \\hat{p}/\\hbar} \\right)\\Big|_{a=0}\n",
    "= \\frac{i}{\\hbar} [\\hat{p}, \\hat{x}] = I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields the **canonical commutation relation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i \\hbar\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Representation in Position Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the commutation relation is established, one can realize the operators concretely in the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} = L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x} \\psi(x) = x \\psi(x), \\quad\n",
    "\\hat{p} \\psi(x) = -i \\hbar \\frac{d}{dx} \\psi(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These forms are consistent with the commutation relation and with the interpretation of $\\hat{p}$ as the generator of spatial translations.\n",

    "- The position operator $\\hat{x}$ is postulated as a self-adjoint operator with continuous spectrum.\n",
    "- A unitary translation operator $T(a)$ is introduced such that it shifts the expectation value of position.\n",
    "- The momentum operator $\\hat{p}$ is defined via Stoneâ€™s theorem as the generator of $T(a)$.\n",
    "- The canonical commutation relation $[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i \\hbar$ is derived without invoking ill-defined position eigenstates.\n"

Welcome to the *Quantum Dynamics* course, 
part of the **Masterâ€™s Program in Chemistry** at the **University of WÃ¼rzburg**.

This course is primarily designed for Masterâ€™s students in Chemistry, 
but students from other disciplines (Physics, Mathematics, etc. ) 
are equally welcome to participate.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

In this course, we will explore the fundamental concepts and methods used to describe and analyze the quantum dynamics of molecular systems. The topics covered include:

- Review of the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics
- Heisenberg, SchrÃ¶dinger and Dirac pictures of Quantum Dynamics
- Time-dependent perturbation theory
- Quantum wave packet dynamics  
- Mixed states and density operators   
- Nonadiabatic effects
- Applications in photochemistry, photophysics and spectroscopy  

The course will combine theoretical foundations with practical examples and computational methods.

## ðŸŽ“ Prerequisites

To follow the course effectively, students should have:

- A solid understanding of **quantum mechanics at the Bachelor level**
- A good grasp of **mathematics**, especially **linear algebra**
- **Programming skills** (preferably in Python) are helpful but *not strictly required*
